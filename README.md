App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
The goal of this project is to identify profitable mobile app profiles for the App Store and Google Play markets. As data analysts for a company that develops Android and iOS apps, our role is to provide insights that guide our developers in making informed, data-driven decisions about the types of apps they should create.

At our company, we exclusively develop apps that are free to download and install, with in-app ads serving as our primary source of revenue. As a result, our earnings from each app are largely dependent on the number of users. This project aims to analyze data to help our developers determine which types of apps are most likely to attract a larger user base.
